        "Is that in addition to the absence of the $250 million headwind from capitalization you\u2019re previously anticipating in the 2025 guidance?",
        "Number one is in terms of our road map, in terms of cash flow, nothing has changed from the previous commentary that I\u2019ve made regarding hey, we\u2019re continuing to focus on managing risk, managing opportunities, making sure that we\u2019re rationalizing investments to get the guidance in the baseline case."

        "As we look going forward, we expect those commitments that NATO countries have made to increase defense spending and general national security spending to 3.5% to 5% respectively of GDP, to continue to provide a basis for this strong awards and sales growth within the company.",
        "But now that we see this funding in the reconciliation bill, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s possible to revise that outlook and, likewise for what it does for the $4 billion of cash flow in 2028.",

        "This builds on the efforts that we and the Air Force have made previously to prepare for a more rapid production ramp.",
        "We are in discussions with the Air Force regarding potential for an accelerated production ramp on the program.",
        "While the ultimate outcome of these discussions remains uncertain, we currently expect any agreement to accelerate production ramp would require further investment by the company to expand production capacity along with the opportunity to earn improved return on the LRIP and NTE production lot.",

        "Lastly, Q4 has historically been our strongest quarter of revenue generation, driven by production schedules and timing of materials.",
        "The MS profile is enabled by continued strong program performance, higher international sales, and seasonal volume increases to higher margin production later in the year.",
        "So the important takeaway here is that the reconciliation bill now provides the funding for the expansion of production capacity for the B-21.",
        "We were already working with the Air Force on plans to accelerate production capacity, and now we are in discussions about how those funds will be used to make that happen.",
        "We are looking to get a fair and equitable business arrangement where we would be incentivized to invest in that production capacity.",
        "I\u2019ve also talked in the past about co-production where we have expertise, but it\u2019s best for a local industrial partner to actually build the capability.",
        "That would be B-21 with the additional $4.5 billion mainly focused on production capacity expansion.",
        "Finally, E-2D, which has a billion and a half additional funding to support the program being extended partly for the Homeland Defense Mission, but also partly just as the only production capability that can match the E-3 and to be a replacement for that capability.",
        "How does the maturation of the command and launch segment change the E&D margin profile for defense through the end of the decade when production starts?",
        "Depending on the final agreement for the production on B-21, we do now believe it could exceed the 10% of our total revenue in the future, but it\u2019s really early to provide any more definitive outlook.",
        "With Sentinel and how large it could become as part of the portfolio, I don\u2019t see it reaching that 10% of revenue in the next couple of years despite the additional funding that we\u2019ve received, but certainly as we move into the production phase of the program.",
        "But as I\u2019ve talked about in munitions and other areas that we are selling off of hot production lines, DCS certainly is a more expeditious way of working with customers.",
        "We\u2019re doing well on supporting the production needs for the current platform.",
        "As a follow-up on B-21 and the potential for an increase in the production ramp there.",
        "Whereas in Q1, there was this charge to potentially accommodate additional production, as things stand here today with additional money and reconciliation, if you were to agree with the Air Force on increased production, you wouldn\u2019t anticipate a further charge on the program.",
        "As I said in my prepared remarks, and we had in the 10-Q, we recognized that accelerating the production ramp will likely require future investment by the company, and our discussions with the Air Force are to accompany that with the opportunity to earn improved return on the program to get a return on that increased investment that we would be making."
